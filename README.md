# Data-Warehouse

It was one of my first projects which let me master **HTML** & **CSS** syntax.

During my work I supported myself using **bootstrap** liblary classes.

Entire site is **fully responsive** and looking nicely on all devices.

It is also **fully accessible** for screen readers.

I was following **BEM metodology** during creating website's classes. 

The website is build in correct **sematic structure**.

Website colors are stored in **CSS variables** in purpose to create flexible theme.

The project is guided by free design created by @Slab Studio and shared in **Figma**.
